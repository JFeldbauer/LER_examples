The data for the hourly simulations comes from
Pierson, D. (2019). Example Model Simulation for Lake Erken from the EU Water JPI project PROGNOS, HydroShare,

The data for the 10-minute simulations are part of the data used in Mesman, J.P., Ayala, A.I., Adrian, R., De Eyto, E.,
Frassl, M.A., Goyette, S., Kasparian, J., Perroud, M., Stelzer, J.A.A., Pierson, D.C., and Ibelings, B.W. (submitted),
Performance of one-dimensional hydrodynamic lake models during short-term extreme weather events.
Like the hourly data, the (originally 5-minute frequency) data was collected by the Erken Laboratory of Uppsala University
and the Swedish Infrastructure for Ecosystem Science (SITES).
