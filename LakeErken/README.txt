The data for the hourly simulations comes from
Pierson, D. (2019). Example Model Simulation for Lake Erken from the EU Water JPI project PROGNOS, HydroShare,

The data for the 10-minute simulations are part of the data used in J.P. Mesman, A.I. Ayala, R. Adrian, E. De Eyto, S. Goyette,
J. Kasparian, M. Perroud, J.A.A. Stelzer, D.C. Pierson & B.W. Ibelings (2020). Performance of one-dimensional hydrodynamic lake models during short-term extreme
weather events. Environmental Modelling & Software, 104852. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104852
Like the hourly data, the (originally 5-minute frequency) data was collected by the Erken Laboratory of Uppsala University
and the Swedish Infrastructure for Ecosystem Science (SITES).
