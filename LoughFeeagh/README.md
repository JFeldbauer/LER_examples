Lough Feeagh data was collected by the Marine Institute. A permanently moored thermistor chain at the deepest point in Lough Feeagh measures water temperature at 13 depths (0.9, 2.5, 5, 8, 11, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 27, 32, 42). This dataset comprises data collected between 2004 and 2019 which has gone through detailed QA/QC. See [here](http://data.marine.ie/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/ie.marine.data:dataset.2817) (de Eyto et al., 2020).
Bathymetry of Lough Feeagh is also available from [here](http://data.marine.ie/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/ie.marine.data:dataset.1226).
